# airbnbDataQuestions-

i couldn't ulpload the data becouse its big
this some questions has been answered by analysing airbnb seattle data, 
removed the rows of null values then removed the dollar($) sign and the comma(,) from the price for more accuracy, then got the highest and lowest prices. 

then showed the most common price been offerd in the city,by applying the value_counts function.

then i looked for their availability through the year and showed it as a plot, reading the listings data then droped colunms with null values then ploting column of avalibaility_360 and using hist kind.
